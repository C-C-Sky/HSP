Introduction
------------
This software is intended for the use of medical centers in need of an efficient up-to-

date application. This application is designed to allow users to sign in as a patient who then will 

be able to fill in their own personal information, medical history as well as schedule an 

appointment with a physician and their current condition. Based on an algorithm we 

developed, if certain criteriaâ€™s are met, an alert may be triggered notifying doctors and nurses 

that a patient is in need of immediate care.  Physician, Nurse and nurses will also have the 

ability to sign into the application and each profile is designed specifically for their role.  This 

application will be able to facilitate the communication between the staff in regards to 

accessing records, prescribing medication and running lab tests.
